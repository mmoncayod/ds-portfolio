+ **Genetic Diversity Analysis in _Diaphorina citri_ Using Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing**
  + **Objective:** To analyze the mitochondrial DNA sequences of _Diaphorina citri_ to assess genetic diversity and population structure, and predict potential spread and evolution of the citrus greening disease.
    
  + **Overview:** _Diaphorina citri_, the Asian citrus psyllid, is a vector for the bacterium _Candidatus Liberibacter_ which causes the citrus greening disease, severely impacting citrus production worldwide and understanding the genetic variation within _D. citri_ populations is crucial for developing effective management strategies against the spread of the disease.
    
  + **Data collection:** The project utilized mitochondrial DNA sequences of _D. citri_ collected from eight locations across two Colombian regions, Valle del Cauca and Quind√≠o. **Macrogen Korea sequenced mitochondrial DNA.**
