+ ## **Genetic Diversity Analysis in _Diaphorina citri_ Using Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing**
  
**Objective:** To analyze the mitochondrial DNA sequences of _Diaphorina citri_ to assess genetic diversity and population structure, and predict the potential spread and evolution of the citrus greening disease.

**Overview:** _Diaphorina citri_, the Asian citrus psyllid, is a vector for the bacterium _Candidatus Liberibacter_ which causes the citrus greening disease, severely impacting citrus production worldwide and understanding the genetic variation within _D. citri_ populations is crucial for developing effective management strategies against the spread of the disease.

**Extract-Transform-Load:** The project utilized mitochondrial DNA sequences of _D. citri_ collected from eight locations across two Colombian regions, Valle del Cauca and Quind√≠o. **Macrogen Korea sequenced mitochondrial DNA.**

  + **Phed quality system as criteria for sequence cutting**
      ![Texto alternativo](/assets/img/prhed_punctuation.png)
      
  + Phed system assigns a score as follows:
      ![Texto alternativo](/assets/img/phred_results.png)

     + Where:
      + Scores of 20 or more: High quality, with an error rate of 1% or less.
      + Scores of 30 or more: Very high quality, with an error rate of 0.1% or less.
      + Scores below 20: Low to moderate quality, with an error rate greater than 1%.

    Phred quality scores tell you the reliability of each base read during sequencing. By trimming sequences based on these scores, you are removing sections of sequences with a high probability of being in error, which can distort your results during alignment and subsequent analyses.

    + **Sequence aligning**
      
      + First: Assemble forward and reverse reads to obtain complete sequences for each sample
   
        + Function to create consensus sequences

      + Second: Align those sequences within each population to compare between samples - Biopython
