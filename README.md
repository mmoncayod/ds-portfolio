+ ##**Genetic Diversity Analysis in _Diaphorina citri_ Using Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing**
  + **Objective:** To analyze the mitochondrial DNA sequences of _Diaphorina citri_ to assess genetic diversity and population structure, and predict potential spread and evolution of the citrus greening disease.
    
  + **Overview:** _Diaphorina citri_, the Asian citrus psyllid, is a vector for the bacterium _Candidatus Liberibacter_ which causes the citrus greening disease, severely impacting citrus production worldwide and understanding the genetic variation within _D. citri_ populations is crucial for developing effective management strategies against the spread of the disease.
    
  + **Extract-Transform-Load:** The project utilized mitochondrial DNA sequences of _D. citri_ collected from eight locations across two Colombian regions, Valle del Cauca and Quind√≠o. **Macrogen Korea sequenced mitochondrial DNA.**

     + **Phed quality system as criteria for sequence cutting**

      + Phed system assigns a score as follows:
      ![Texto alternativo](/assets/img/Miguel-1.jpg)

     + Where:
      + Scores of 20 or more: High quality, with an error rate of 1% or less.
      + Scores of 30 or more: Very high quality, with an error rate of 0.1% or less.
      + Scores below 20: Low to moderate quality, with an error rate greater than 1%.

Phred quality scores tell you the reliability of each base read during sequencing. By trimming sequences based on these scores, you are removing sections of sequences that have a high probability of being in error, which can distort your results during alignment and subsequent analyses.
